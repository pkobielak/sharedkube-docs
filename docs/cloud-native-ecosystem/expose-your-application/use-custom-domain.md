# Use Custom Domain

There is also a possibility to assign a custom domain to your service.

### Set up your domain

To set up your domain to associate with your service on sharedkube, you need to add a TXT
record to your domain's DNS settings with a `sharedkube.io` as a value.

```
TXT sharedkube.io
```

Then contact us via [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sharedkube-community/shared_invite/zt-1ocap8cg6-boDX9eEPSQBQ0S6zllzcGA)
or [email](mailto:support@sharedkube.io)  and provide us with your domain name. We will verify your ownership of the domain
and help you with the setup.
